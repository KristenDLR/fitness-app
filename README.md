## New Feature Request

Users have requested a feature that allows them to schedule a “session” which describes a future date/time that they want to complete a given routine. The PM has asked you to start work on the view that will show the user’s sessions.

They want a way for a user to see their already schedule
It must include a record of whether the session has been completed or not and some sort of easy to identify means of recognizing completed sessions.

Using the boilerplate, create a react app that will load a single page that renders the sessions from the provided graphQL server. Look in the readme for instructions on how to start the graphQL server.

- Some of the data provided in the mock endpoint is incomplete. Feel free to add relevant fields to the schema.
- UI/UX design of the display is up to you.
- Take the design and functionality as far as you desire.
